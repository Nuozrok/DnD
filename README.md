# DnD


So while implementing an experience system, I ran into the same problem i had with trying to get the player
to freely be able to check their stats... I dont know how to do it. I dont know how to get the program to
constantly check if the player leveled up (or if the player is asking to see their stats, etc...).
Putting it in an if loop results in nothing else being allowed to happen until the player levels up
(or decides to check their stats, etc...).

TL;DR
Need to find out a way to check if an event occured while the program is running something else.
I looked up multi-threading over the summer, but couldnt get that to work.





(to do) don't forget to check that the door isn't already assigned
(to do) enemies need to give experience on death
